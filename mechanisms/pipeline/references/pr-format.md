# PR format

**Status: drafted, awaiting Amel's confirmation** (`DESIGN.md` sections 8 and 9), including whether the full structure is kept or trimmed. Until he confirms, this is the format the pipeline uses.

It is Scruffy's feature-dev PR body, adapted for Taimi's situation: no external reviewer, auto-merge on a verdict, and a weekly build that reads a changelog.

The body is read by Amel after the fact and by future-Amel, not by a stranger. It also has one machine-readable job: auto-merge gates on the verdict, so the verdict comes first.

## Rules

- **Ready for review, not draft.** GitHub auto-merge does not apply to draft PRs, so Taimi PRs open ready.
- **No reviewers assigned.** There is no external reviewer.
- **Auto-merge eligibility.** Only a `MERGE-READY` verdict is eligible. `REVIEW NEEDED` and `PROOF INCOMPLETE` PRs stay open for Amel. See `RUNNER.md` step 7.
- **One feature per PR, kept small**, so a bad merge is a one-command revert.
- If the repo has its own PR template, mirror its headings where they do not conflict with the order below.
- The verdict line is exactly `MERGE-READY`, `REVIEW NEEDED` or `PROOF INCOMPLETE`, alone on the first line of the body.

## Body, in order

1. **Verdict.** First line: `MERGE-READY`, `REVIEW NEEDED` or `PROOF INCOMPLETE`.
2. **What this adds.** One line, in the words of someone who wants it, not someone who built it.
3. **Why.** The problem it solves, with a link to the Decisions Log row (or council outcome) that approved it.
4. **Proof block.** Pasted verbatim from QA: verdict tier, claims table with commit hashes, the command to replay it, and the mandatory `Not proven` line. For a cross-platform feature this carries the Chief of Engineering's reconciled verdict.
5. **Acceptance criteria.** A table of each criterion and the passing test that proves it, by name. For a cross-platform feature, split by platform.
6. **Non-goals.** What this deliberately does not do. Pre-empts the "shouldn't it also…" question.
7. **Design.** Two or three sentences, and the rejected alternative with the trade-off when a council disagreement or a real alternative existed.
8. **Blast radius.** What reads this and what it changes. Say plainly when it only adds. For cross-platform work, name the contract at the seam and that the Chief of Engineering signed off.
9. **Evidence.** Screenshots against the design mock from QA's captured pair, and the accessibility tree result, for anything visual. A non-UI change says so in one line.
10. **Assumptions.** One line each wherever the spec was inferred rather than stated, naming the test that asserts the inference.
11. **Unverified criteria.** Named. A PR quiet about what it could not verify is worse than one that admits it.
12. **Review log.** The count of Reviewer findings resolved, plus any Minor findings carried forward.
13. **Docs updated.** The Notion pages and Decisions Log rows the Docs-Keeper changed for this feature.
14. **How to test by hand.** Replaces Scruffy's "how to review". Amel tests manually in the weekly build, so: the screen to open, the device, and what to try.
15. **How to revert.** The one-command undo: a revert of the merge commit, or the flag or config if the repo already uses one.
16. **Follow-ups.** Linked tickets for everything deliberately deferred.
17. **Changelog line.** One user-facing sentence. The weekly build collects these into the changelog.

Section 17 is written under the exact heading `## Changelog line` so the release step can collect it mechanically.
