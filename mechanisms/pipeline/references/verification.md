# Verification

Forked from Scruffy's `verification` skill at the point of the Taimi split, cut down to features. Taimi keeps its own copy and does not stay in sync with Scruffy.

Owned by the QA role of each platform (`roles/qa-<platform>/`). Everything else in the pipeline produces a claim. This produces the thing that can say **no**, and its verdict is what auto-merge gates on.

## The one rule

**Never claim a thing is verified without output you can point at.**

Not "it looks correct", not "the tests should pass". A command, its output, and what it proves. Every claim below is written so it can fail. A check that cannot fail is not a check.

## Two QA modes

QA does two jobs, and they run as separate agents so the model that built a thing never grades it.

| Mode | When | Context |
|---|---|---|
| **Author** | after acceptance-criteria lock, before any implementation | Writes the red tests and records their hashes. Sees the spec, the criteria, the non-goals and the repo. |
| **Audit** | after implementation | A fresh context, read-only on the repo (it may add files only under `evidence/` and use throwaway worktrees). Receives a packet and nothing else. |

**The audit packet:** repo path, dossier path, `parent` / `test_commit` / `head` SHAs, the test files with the hashes recorded when they went red, the test and suite commands, cost class, `evidence/baseline.txt`, the acceptance criteria and non-goals, the `ui-touch.sh` output for `parent..head`, and the capture reports when a pair was taken.

**Not in the packet:** the plan, the design notes, the seam notes, the Developers' reports, or any implementer reasoning. Including them re-creates the bias the split exists to remove. A caller that includes them is ignored.

Anything in the packet missing → return `PROOF INCOMPLETE` naming the missing field. Do not reconstruct it by guesswork.

If no independent audit agent can be dispatched, run the audit inline and put `audited in-context, not independent` on the `Not proven` line. That demotes the verdict to REVIEW NEEDED at best. A self-graded MERGE-READY is the thing this module exists to prevent.

## Discover the economics first

Before anything else, find out what a test run costs. This governs how many iterations are affordable. It is discovered, not configured. The Team Lead's project memory may already carry it.

- What is the build system (`BUILD.bazel`, `Package.swift`, `build.gradle`, `package.json`, `go.mod`)?
- How does CI run the tests? The CI config is the most reliable source for the real command.
- Time one run. Actually time it.

| Loop | Looks like | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| **Cheap**, seconds | Jest, package targets, unit tests, Go | Revert check mandatory. Iterate freely. No batching, no build slot. |
| **Expensive**, minutes to tens of minutes | full app build, emulator, integration suites | Revert check skipped. Probes batched. Build slot semaphore. |

**The timing run is also the baseline run.** It happens on the parent commit before any change. Keep its result: pass count and the names of any failures, in `evidence/baseline.txt`. Every later suite claim reads **no new failures against baseline**, not "green". When the loop is too expensive to afford a full baseline run, say so in the proof block rather than implying a clean start.

## Acceptance tests, red first

**One test per acceptance criterion.** Not one test for the feature. Done is when the last red test goes green and none of the others broke.

A red test is any artifact that fails before the feature exists and passes after: unit, integration, snapshot, accessibility-tree assertion, a script. The form does not matter; the falsifiability does. Three properties, all required:

- It asserts the criterion as locked, in the conditions the criterion states.
- It sits at a seam on the real call path, not a parallel path that happens to be easier to reach.
- It was **observed red**. Not assumed red.

**Where the expected behaviour was inferred rather than stated, the inference is the assertion, verbatim**, so the riskiest guess in the run is challenged in the one line of code the Reviewer reads anyway. The PR's assumption line names this test.

The procedure, in Author mode:

1. Write the tests. Run them. Watch every one go red. Keep the failure output in `evidence/`; it is the proof that the tests can fail.
2. Hash each test file and record it:

   ```bash
   shasum -a 256 <test file> | tee -a evidence/red-test.sha
   ```

3. **Commit the tests on their own, before any implementation commit.** The branch history `parent → tests → implementation` is the reviewer-facing proof the tests were not written to fit the code. Record the test-commit SHA.

**A test that will not go red means the behaviour already exists.** Stop and send it back to the architect: you are about to build something twice. Three attempts, then back to the plan.

**The forbidden move is weakening an assertion until it passes.** It is the easiest thing to cheat in this whole workflow and it turns the system into theatre.

**A criterion with no seam to test it** is an earned exception, never a ticked box: three genuine attempts, then it is named in the PR as unverified. Do not quietly drop it. Do not build a harness nobody asked for.

A visual criterion with a design mock behind it is testable: screenshot-versus-mock comparison and the accessibility tree are QA's evidence for it. A visual criterion with no mock is named as unverified.

## The failure modes

| Mode | Looks like | Response |
|---|---|---|
| **Process** | toolchain broken, device gone, suite cannot run, disk full | **No retry loop.** Report, mark proof incomplete, name the exact failing check. |
| **Solution** | a test stays red, the suite breaks | **3 repair attempts per track**, then that track is blocked with a written summary. |

Never silently discard work. A failed verification keeps the worktree.

## The claims, in Audit mode

Each is independently able to fail.

**1. Tests unchanged since red.** Re-hash every test file at `head`; each must equal the recorded hash. `git log --follow -p <test file>` must show the test arriving in `test_commit` and untouched after. A mismatch is reported, not absorbed. If a test genuinely had to move, re-run it red on the parent commit, record a new hash, and give it a new test-only commit.

**2. Tests fail without the feature.** Run the test command at `test_commit`. Every criterion's test must fail, for the reason the criterion states: read the assertion and compare. A test failing for an unrelated reason (compile error, missing fixture) proves nothing.

**3. Tests pass with the feature.** Same command at `head`. All green.

**4. No new suite failures against baseline.** The repo's suite, compared with `evidence/baseline.txt` by failure name, not only count. Paste commands and the delta: pass counts, not full logs. "Same two pre-existing failures as parent" is a pass. A clean-sounding "suite green" with no baseline behind it is not a claim.

**5. Nothing else moved.**
- Snapshot failure on a component the diff touched → intentional, update the baseline.
- Snapshot failure on one it did not touch → possible regression, `decision needed`, never auto-updated.
- A suite re-run to green is `blocked` and flagged flaky. Not a pass. Before flagging it, check whether the test waits on a wall-clock delay; if so, replace the sleep with a poll on the actual condition and re-audit. A test that stays flaky after the swap is a real finding.

**6. Scope drift and non-goals.** From `git diff --stat <parent> <head>`, list touched components and check each against the criteria. Nothing outside the criteria changed. Read the diff against each non-goal; a feature that quietly grew past its stated boundary is the most common thing to miss, and its author is the last to notice.

**7. Criterion table.** Every acceptance criterion maps to a passing test, **by name**. Not "the suite is green". For a cross-platform feature, the table is split by platform.

**8. Static analysis and dead code.** The project's analyzer and a dead-code check on the diff. New findings against baseline are reported.

**9. Process-death and backgrounding**, for stateful features: kill and background the app mid-flow and show the state survives as the criteria say. Not applicable to stateless changes (say so in the row).

**10. Reviewer evidence, where the diff touches UI.** `mechanisms/pipeline/scripts/ui-touch.sh <repo> <parent> <head>` decides, mechanically, whether it is owed.
- `NON-UI` → `not applicable — NON-UI` and nothing else.
- `UI` → all of: before and after captures with matching build identity at `parent` and `head`; the screenshot compared against the design mock; the accessibility tree dumped; and `mechanisms/pipeline/scripts/pair-diff.py before after --mask <the gate element's frame, in screenshot pixels>` exiting 0.
  - Exit 1: the pair differs outside the mask. Not shipped; re-capture once, then `decision needed` with both images.
  - Exit 2: process failure, never a pass. Row reads `MISSING: size mismatch <bw>x<bh> vs <aw>x<ah>`, `MISSING: mask invalid <value>`, or `MISSING: mask too large <value>`.
  - Exit 3: nothing changed inside the mask. `FAILED: nothing visibly changed`.
  - After exit 0, judge from the two images and the mock whether the *right* thing changed, with nothing else visibly altered. Default to fail when unsure. One sentence in the row.
- `mechanisms/pipeline/scripts/tree-diff.py` on the two tree dumps is reported on its own row and **never changes the verdict**, in either direction. A tree can look correct while the UI is visibly broken, so it cannot stand in for the pair.
- `UI` with no verified pair is `PROOF INCOMPLETE`, named on the `Not proven` line.

**11. Revert check, cheap loop only.** In a scratch worktree at `head`, reverse the implementation while keeping the tests, and expect red:

```bash
git diff <test_commit> <head> -- . ':(exclude)<test file>' | git apply -R
```

Expensive loop: record `skipped — expensive loop, the red commit stands in`.

**12. Blast radius, derived yourself.** For each changed symbol others read (a default, a protocol, a config key, a shared component's props, a stored data shape), grep its callers. Contained or shared, with the caller count as evidence. Do not take the Team Lead's word for it.

## The proof block

One block, fixed shape, pasted verbatim into the PR body (in a collapsible section headed by the verdict tier). A fixed shape is the point: Amel learns to read it in ten seconds.

```markdown
## Proof

**Verdict: MERGE-READY**   (or REVIEW NEEDED / PROOF INCOMPLETE — with the reason, one line)

| Claim | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Fails without feature | `<command>` at `<test-commit sha>` — exit 1, "<one-line failure excerpt per criterion>" |
| Passes with feature | same command at `<head sha>` — pass |
| Tests unchanged since red | test-only commit `<sha>`, untouched since — `git log --follow -p <file>` |
| Suite | <N> passed at head; baseline at parent: <N> passed (or: same <k> pre-existing failures, named) |
| Scope drift / non-goals | touched components listed; each non-goal checked |
| Revert check | done / skipped — expensive loop, the red commit stands in |
| Accessibility check (informational — never changes the verdict) | `tree-diff.py` — `a11y: UNCHANGED / CHANGED / ATTENTION` and its findings, or `not applicable` / `UNAVAILABLE <why>` |
| Reviewer evidence | `capture-before.png` @ `<parent sha>`, `capture-after.png` @ `<head sha>`, gate `<label role>`, pair-diff `changed=<f> inside=<f>` exit 0, right-change: "<one sentence>" — or `not applicable — NON-UI` — or `MISSING: <status>` |

**Replay:** `git checkout <test-commit> && <command>`  (expect red) `&& git checkout <head> && <command>`  (expect green)
**Not proven:** what could not be checked and why — or "nothing".
```

For a cross-platform feature the block also carries each platform's verdict and the Chief of Engineering's reconciled verdict.

Rules:

- **Every cell is a command, a SHA, or a count.** A cell that reads "verified ✓" is the self-attestation this block replaces.
- **Replay is generated on cheap loops, always.** On expensive loops state the cost instead ("replay is a 35-minute build; red output archived below") and fold the raw red failure output into a `<details>` block under the table. Trust-me is acceptable only with the receipt attached.
- **The `Not proven` line is mandatory**, even when it says "nothing". Its absence is indistinguishable from silence about a gap.
- A `MISSING` cell in the Reviewer evidence row is repeated on the `Not proven` line. A `not applicable` cell never is.

## The verdict

Three tiers, so "can this merge on its own" is mechanical rather than a feeling.

| Verdict | Means | Criteria — all of them |
|---|---|---|
| **MERGE-READY** | eligible for auto-merge on the proof alone | contained blast radius, claims 1–8 proven, claim 9 proven or not applicable, revert check done or expensive-loop exemption, suite delta against baseline is zero, nothing in `Not proven`, Reviewer evidence row is a verified pair or `not applicable` |
| **REVIEW NEEDED** | the proof holds but the judgement is Amel's | shared blast radius, a design or trade-off embedded in the diff, or any earned exception: no seam, an unverifiable criterion |
| **PROOF INCOMPLETE** | do not merge on this | any process failure, any claim that could not run, a `UI` diff with a `MISSING` Reviewer evidence row, an independent audit that could not be dispatched and was not demoted |

**A UI diff without a verified pair cannot be MERGE-READY.** This is a gate, not a reminder.

**Radius trumps greenness.** A shared-radius change self-demotes to REVIEW NEEDED however green it is: the tests prove the criteria, not the blast radius.

**A new contract at a seam is not, by itself, shared radius.** A cross-platform feature that introduces its own contract (an endpoint, a data shape nothing else reads) and has the Chief of Engineering's seam sign-off is contained. A change that alters a contract other code already reads is shared.

For a cross-platform feature, the **Chief of Engineering reconciles** the platforms' verdicts. The feature's verdict is the lowest tier of any platform, unless the Chief records a reason the lower verdict does not apply to the feature as a whole. A reconciliation never raises a tier above what a platform's own proof supports.

Auto-merge is eligible only for `MERGE-READY`. `REVIEW NEEDED` and `PROOF INCOMPLETE` PRs stay open for Amel.

## Dossier

`.taimi/<feature-key>/evidence/` holds every command and its output, including (especially) the red failures and the baseline. Verdicts, attempt counts, the test hashes and the test-commit SHA go in `state.md`.

**Every evidence file starts with a three-line header:** the commit SHA it ran against, the exact command, the toolchain or device identifier. Output with no provenance cannot be re-trusted later.

A check that could not run is stated, never omitted. A verification quiet about what it could not verify is worse than one that admits it.
